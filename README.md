## Hi, I'm DavidðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software engineer who is always looking for an open-source project to contribute to and better my skills. Some technologies I enjoy working with are C/C++, java and python. I also keep up to date with current technologies trying to stay up to date with everything.
